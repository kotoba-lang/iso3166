;; ## Why embed at all
;;
;; There is no portable `io/resource`. Reading `resources/<path>` relative to
;; the process's working directory is right while this library is the root
;; project and wrong the moment it is a dependency — measured 2026-08-18 in
;; `kotoba-lang/technology`, whose registry came back nil for all 159 of
;; iso3166's assertions because nbb's cwd was iso3166's root, not its own.
;; This library has the same consumers ahead of it.
;;
;; The EDN files stay the source of truth and the thing a human edits. The
;; generated namespace is a projection, checked by `--check`, and it is what
;; the library reads — no runtime file access, no cwd assumption, works in a
;; browser.
