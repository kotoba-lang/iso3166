# kotoba-iso3166

ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country registry for kotoba-lang and itonami open
businesses -- the jurisdiction/market-entry counterpart to `kotoba-industry`
(ISIC-coded businesses), `kotoba-occupation` (ISCO-08-coded occupations),
and `kotoba-cofog` (COFOG-coded government functions).

This repository maps each country to the technology capabilities needed to
run an independent public-sector market-entry & procurement-compliance
navigator business for that jurisdiction.

## Contract

```clojure
(require '[kotoba.iso3166 :as iso3166])

(iso3166/get-country "JPN")
(iso3166/required-technologies "DEU")
(iso3166/readiness "USA" #{:identity :forms :dmn :bpmn :audit-ledger})
```

## Layers

- business: customer-facing open ISO 3166 market-entry blueprint
- iso3166: country-coded operating domain (which jurisdiction's rules apply)
- technology: reusable kotoba-lang capability stack
- implementation: concrete repos, services and operators

ISIC classifies what a *business* produces; ISCO classifies what a *worker*
does; COFOG classifies what *government function* a service serves; ISO 3166
classifies **which jurisdiction's market-entry and public-procurement rules
apply**. `cloud-itonami-iso3166-{code}` publishes forkable OSS operator
businesses that help an ALREADY-INCORPORATED operator win and service a
public-sector contract in that specific country -- distinct from
`cloud-itonami-M6910` (company *incorporation* itself) and from
`cloud-itonami-cofog-{code}` (a jurisdiction-agnostic operator template for
ONE public function). See `docs/cloud-itonami.md` for the full boundary with
adjacent etzhayyim/cloud-itonami actors.

At the COUNTRY level, a country is not itself a business-function taxonomy,
so entries are FLAT -- every one of the 193 current UN-member states is
independently blueprint-eligible. ADR-2607040100 adds a SECOND, AGENCY level
for Japan only (`:level :ministry` / `:agency` / `:independent-commission`,
`:parent "JPN"`), mirroring COFOG's division/group coordinator+leaf pattern
(ADR-2606301900): `cloud-itonami-iso3166-jpn` is the country-level
coordinator, and per-agency blueprints (`cloud-itonami-iso3166-jpn-meti`,
etc.) are leaves under it. Use `(iso3166/children "JPN")` to list them. Other
countries stay flat until this pattern is validated.

80/193 countries are at or above `:blueprint` (77 `:blueprint` + 3 `:implemented`). USA now has a deliberate 15-body agency-level extension (parent `USA`), mirroring the Japan coordinator+leaf pattern. Remaining country entries stay `:spec` for future promotion along the same maturity ladder.
