  "The ISO 3166-1 country registry, portable.

  ## Why this is `.cljc` and not `.clj`

  Two lines made this namespace JVM-only — `(slurp (io/resource …))` for the
  registry and for the contacts — and `kotoba.technology`, which this
  requires, had the same one. Between them, every consumer of either was
  pinned to the JVM. This workspace's runtime order is kotoba-wasm →
  clojurewasm → ClojureScript → nbb, with the JVM last; a registry of facts
  is the last thing that should decide a consumer's runtime.

  There is no portable `io/resource`. Under `:clj` this reads the classpath
  resource; under `:cljs` it reads from disk relative to the process's
  working directory, which works under nbb and Node and does not work in a
  browser.

  ## No runtime file access at all

  The obvious `:cljs` substitute for `io/resource` — reading
  `resources/<path>` relative to the working directory — is right only while
  this library is the root project. That was measured wrong the same day in
  `kotoba-lang/technology`: its registry came back nil for all 159 of this
  library's assertions under nbb, because nbb's cwd was this repo's root and
  not that one. This library has consumers ahead of it and would have
  inherited the fault.

  So both resources are compiled in, as the generated
  `kotoba.iso3166.embedded`, projected from the EDN by
  `tools/gen-embedded.cljs`. The EDN stays the thing a human edits; `--check`
  refuses to let them drift.

  **A registry handed in as nil still propagates as nil.** `(into {} …)` over
  nil yields `{}`, so `by-code` would answer a complete-looking index over no
  data and `get-country` nil for every code — a caller passing nothing must
  not receive that."
